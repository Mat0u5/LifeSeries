# Full changelog from version `1.3.5` to `*`.

----------

You no longer get teleported to your death position when you final die below the world, which fixes a bug where you get stuck in a death loop, since you can die to the void in spectator mode for some reason...<br>
Tested and implemented the new resourcepacks.

----------

Added a way to set a specific players' task to what you want, using the `/task set player <task_difficulty> <task>` command.<br>
If the player already has a task book, it will be instantly replaced with the new one. If not, this command will force their task to be what you set it to on the next randomization.<br>
So for example: `/task set Mat0u5 easy Open the end portal.` would give the player Mat0u5 the easy task book which says "Open the end portal".

----------

Removed Cardinal Components API dependency.
Completely reworked the animal disguise backend to no longer need CCAPI.

----------

Fixed animal disguise limb rendering.
Animal disguise model no longer appears when you're in spectator or if you have invisibility.
