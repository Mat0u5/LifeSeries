# Life Series Mod
This server-side mod is a one-to-one recreation of [Grian](https://www.youtube.com/c/Grian)'s Life Series in minecraft fabric, with as many QOL features as possible. 
This includes automated lives tracking, automated team colors, automated session timer, automatic Boogeyman selection and kill tracking, and much more.<br>
Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/QWJxfb4zQZ) or make an issue if you want to submit any bugs / give suggestions.
## Features

Currently, the first five seasons of the Life Series are implemented. The latest season, Wild Life, is much more complicated, but it is planned to be released.

## Usage
### Selecting a series
After first starting a server with this mod installed, you will need to choose the series you want. You can do this with the `/lifeseries setSeries <series>` command. Don't worry, you don't have to remember all of this, you will be given instructions in chat ;) <br>
After you select your series, you must restart the server.

### Starting a session
To start a session, you must first set its length using `/session timer set <time>`. The `<time>` field is a string, which includes the hours, minutes and seconds you want the session to last - example valid values: `30m`,`1h`, `1h45m`, `2h35m20s` <br>
After you set your session time, you can simply run `/session start` to start the session.<br>

### The Blacklists
Every session has certain blacklisted items to prevent players from getting to overpowered, just like Grian's series, where some for example banned enchantment tables and similar OP items.<br>
Since I am creating this mod mainly for the group of players I am playing with, the Blacklists are catered to how we feel a balanced series should look like.<br>
For Example most of the series have maces, end crystals, strength pots,... banned.<br>
Blacklisted items are automatically deleted from inventories, and cannot even be crafted.<br>
A similar feature to the item blacklist is enchantment clamping, which limits specific (mainly combat) enchantments to level 1.<br>
On series where bookshelves are banned, the enchantment table has been modified a little bit to give all enchantments (because in vanilla its impossible to get some without bookshelves), and its also possible to get higher levels on some enchants directly from the table (like efficiency, unbreaking, fortune,...)

### Config
- The config files are all located in the `config/lifeseries/*` folder. There are files for every series, where you can modify the gameplay for each one of them.<br>
- Reload the config using `/lifeseries reload` or simply the vanilla `/reload`
- Currently, you can modify these (check the config files themselves for more info):
  - Default number of lives, the blacklists, Clamped enchants, spawn egg drop rates, if players drop items when they lose their last life ** and much, much more**.
  - Tasks in Secret Life (`config/lifeseries/secretlife/` folder) - there are three files, where you can modify / add / remove the easy, hard and red tasks.
